    <h2>Python Slot Machine Game</h2>
    <p>
        This is a simple Python slot machine game where you can deposit money, place bets, 
        and spin the slot machine to win or lose money. The game allows you to choose the 
        number of lines to bet on and the amount to bet on each line. It then simulates a 
        slot machine spin and determines your winnings based on the symbols that appear on 
        the lines. You can continue playing until you decide to quit.
